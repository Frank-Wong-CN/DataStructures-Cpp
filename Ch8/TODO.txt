list.c
	modified DeleteList, when argument is NULL, just return, in order to avoid parsing NULL pointer

graph.c
	DFS and BFS modified (so that it can iterate through cyclic graphs)
	

graph.h
	added a new global variable __Graph_CurrentYieldedNodeSet

graph_ds_interface.h

adjacency_list.c
	in RemoveVertex, remove the edge list of the vertex as well
		
DS Interface and Graph main algorithm should be futher decoupled!
Graph.c should not know what ds implementation is!
